		\begin{abstract}

We present new data probing short-range correlations (SRC) in nuclei through the measurement of electron scattering off high-momentum nucleons in
light nuclei. The inclusive cross section ratios of $^4$He to $^3$He and $^{12}$C to $^3$He are observed to be both $Q^2$ and $x$ independent
for $1.5 < x <2$, confirming the previously observed dominance of two-nucleon short-range corrections. We also examine the $Q^2$ dependence for
$x > 2$ where previous data suggested that scattering from three-nucleon correlations might dominate the cross section.

%We find that the cross section ratios do not agree with an earlier measurement which suggested a dominance of 3N-SRCs, and do not exhibit the
%behavior expected in a naive model of 3N-SRCs. The deviations from this simple picture may simply be due to failure of the approximations made in the
%simple model, and data at larger $Q^2$ may offer a more definitive answer on the question of 3N-SRCs.


%We also present the first measurement of the $\mathrm{^{48}Ca}$ to $\mathrm{^{40}Ca}$ cross section ratio and the result indicates the universality of two-nucleon corrections for high-momentum nucleons in the isotopes.
