	\title{Measurement of short-range correlations in nuclei at $x>1$ in inclusive quasi-elastic
		electron scattering}

		\begin{abstract}
		We present new results of short-range correlations (SRC) with the measurement of electron scattering off high-momentum nucleons in a wide range of nuclei performed in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. The inclusive cross section ratio of $\mathrm{^{4}He}$ to $\mathrm{^{3}He}$ conforms the well-known two-nucleon short-range correction (2N-SRC) plateau in $1<x<2$ but yields a different pattern when extending to the $x>2$ regime where previous measurements claimed an onset of the three-nucleon short-range correlation (3N-SRC) under a similar kinematic region. The $\mathrm{^{12}C}$ to $\mathrm{^{3}He}$ and $\mathrm{^{12}C}$ to $\mathrm{^{4}He}$ cross section ratios also show no indication of 3N-SRC plateau. 
%We also present the first measurement of the $\mathrm{^{48}Ca}$ to $\mathrm{^{40}Ca}$ cross section ratio and the result indicates the universality of two-nucleon corrections for high-momentum nucleons in the isotopes.
