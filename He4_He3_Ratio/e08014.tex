\begin{abstract}

We present new data probing short-range correlations (SRCs) in nuclei through the measurement of electron scattering off high-momentum nucleons in
light nuclei. The inclusive cross section ratios of $^4$He/$^3$He and $^{12}$C/$^3$He are observed to be both $x$ and $Q^2$ independent
for $1.5 < x <2$, confirming the previously observed dominance of two-nucleon short-range correlations. The cross section ratios for
$x > 2$ do not agree with an earlier measurement which suggested that three-nucleon correlations dominated the interaction in this $Q^2$ range.
While 3N-SRCs may have an important contribution, these data suggest that they cannot be isolated in the same simple fashion as 2N-SRCs.
